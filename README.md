# IoT-Thermostat
My work on an arduino based IoT thermostat using MQTT

The different folders were for testing different aspects and libraries. Including learning to use MQTT and building a basic thermostat.

Eventually they will be removed and the folder reduced to a single working copy. For now they are still references. 
Several of the libraries were not created by me and are subject to their respective owners licensing.
